A sprint + stamina GUI support script for Roblox Lua.
I also made some comments explaining, where to increase or decrease the stamina usage, and increase the regen rate.

This is only a script, what you need to have only is a bar or anything.

GUI Name: StaminaGUI
Frame Name: StaminaFrame2

What I made it look like: https://imgur.com/a/bfAXjAy

Features:

Ability to regen.
Work with GUI.
It only regen after a second if you use it to the max, or it only regen after 0.3 seconds if you use some of it.
